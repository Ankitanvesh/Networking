# Packet Switching and Circuit switching

Packet Switching | Circuit Switching
-----|-----
In this type the messages are divided into packets before they are sent. Each packet is transmitted individually and can follow different routes or destination. | It is a type of communication in which a channel is established for transmission. It is ideal for communication where data is to be transmitted in real time.
In packet switching data is processed at all the intermediate nodes including source system | In circuit switching data is processed at only the source system
In packet switching each packet only knows about the final destination| Data knows entire path address
In packet switching data is processed at each intermediate node where its path is decided by routers| Data is processed at the source system only
Delay between packets is non uniform| Delay is uniform
It is less reliable but is more effecient due to less wastage of resources | More reliable but less effiecient
